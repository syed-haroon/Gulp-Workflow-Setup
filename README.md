#Gulp Workflow Setup

Just pull and quickly get stared with your project

To run as development environment, in CLI type: `gulp` <br>
To run as production environment, in CLI type: `NODE_ENV=production gulp`

### Bug
There is one bug, if someone can help me fixing it, that will be great help :) <br>
When I run `gulp` in CLI, somehow **css/style.css** (folder and file) is created in project root. <br>
I am not sure what I am doing wrong, otherwise everything is just working fine.
